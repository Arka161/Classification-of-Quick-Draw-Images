In this challenge, we use different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to classify the images picked from the Quick Draw Dataset and compare their performances. The code for the best model is uploaded to this repo.

Steps on how to run the program: 

1. Upload my .ipynb file to Jupyter or Colab (or any iPython notebook renderer of your choice)
2. Replace the directory for train and test npz files. The weights are not included in this project, but the code on how to generate the weights is shared.
3. Run the code.
